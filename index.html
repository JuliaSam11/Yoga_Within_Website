				Power yoga is a dynamic and invigorating yoga practice, always moving safely and mindfully with your breath.
				Power yoga enthusiasts say it enhances stamina, flexibility, posture, and mental focus. 
				Like all physical activities, it also relieves tension  and releases toxins through sweat. 
				Because it is rigorous, it burns more calories than most traditional forms of yoga and therefore can help with weight loss.
